<h3 id= "careerGoalsTab">---------------CAREER GOALS---------------</h3>
    <p>I'm a procrastinator and don't know what my career goals are so i'll just tell you how I got here </p>
    <br>
    <p>So basically I started off the the University Of Utah studying Marketing and Design, and I absolutely hated it.
        I thought it was just my major that was making me hate it so much so I switched my major to Communications.
        That didn't do the trick whatsoever so I sat down with parents and we decided that college was doing what I 
        had hoped for. Ultimately I started to look into coding bootcamps. I've always had a love for tech so I thought
        I would give it a try.  Spoiler Alert! I freaking love it. And that's my super badass life story! 
    </p>
<br>
    <p>Thanks for tuning in!</p>
